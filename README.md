# 💹 MACRA - Market Credibility Risk Analyzer

**MACRA** (Market Credibility Risk Analyzer) is a real-time vulnerability analysis platform that quantifies the market's credit credibility by integrating population-scale credit metrics, banking risk, and macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, unemployment rates, and public sentiment. It provides a data-driven *Market Vulnerability Score* to aid analysts, regulators, and financial institutions in forecasting regional or national market stability.

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Traditional financial institutions lack real-time, comprehensive tools that assess the aggregated credit risk and macroeconomic vulnerability of a population or region. This absence limits early warning capabilities during volatile conditions—especially in developing economies where financial transparency is low and sentiment-driven events can trigger large-scale instability.

---

## ✅ Proposed Solution

MACRA computes a dynamic **Market Vulnerability Score (MVS)** by fusing:

- Individual and institutional credit behavior
- Aggregated bank risk indicators
- Macroeconomic indicators (GDP trends, unemployment)
- Sentiment signals (e.g., news & social media tone)

It delivers these insights via a responsive dashboard, exposing APIs for advanced use and enabling real-time scenario testing.

## 🧠 Core Features

- 📊 **Dynamic Market Vulnerability Score (MVS)**
- 🌐 **Region-wise Economic Heatmaps**
- 📉 **What-if simulations for economic shocks**
- 📡 **Sentiment analytics via NLP (future extension)**
- 📱 **Developer-friendly REST API access**
- 🧮 **Explainable ML models for financial interpretability**
