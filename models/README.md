## Machine Learning Models for Market Credibility Prediction

This project implements several machine learning models aimed at predicting market credibility based on various features derived from the dataset. Below is a summary of the models included in this project:

### 1. Logistic Regression
- **Description**: A statistical model that uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. It is suitable for binary classification problems.
- **Expected Performance**: Logistic Regression is expected to provide a baseline performance for the credibility prediction task. It is interpretable and efficient for smaller datasets.

### 2. Decision Tree Classifier
- **Description**: A non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. It splits the data into subsets based on feature values.
- **Expected Performance**: Decision Trees can capture non-linear relationships and interactions between features. However, they may overfit on small datasets.

### 3. Random Forest Classifier
- **Description**: An ensemble method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes for classification tasks.
- **Expected Performance**: Random Forest is expected to improve accuracy and robustness compared to a single decision tree by reducing overfitting.

### 4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Description**: A supervised learning model that analyzes data for classification and regression analysis. It finds the hyperplane that best separates the classes.
- **Expected Performance**: SVM is effective in high-dimensional spaces and is versatile, but it may require careful tuning of parameters.

### 5. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
- **Description**: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, with each new model attempting to correct the errors made by the previous ones.
- **Expected Performance**: GBM is expected to provide high predictive accuracy and is robust against overfitting when tuned properly.

### Model Evaluation
Each model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation will be employed to ensure the reliability of the performance estimates.

### Conclusion
The models implemented in this project aim to provide a comprehensive approach to predicting market credibility. Further tuning and experimentation may be necessary to optimize performance based on the specific characteristics of the dataset.
